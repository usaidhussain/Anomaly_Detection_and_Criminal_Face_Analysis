# Anomaly_Detection_and_Criminal_Face_Analysis
A final year project focused on implementing machine learning techniques to identify anomalies and recognize criminal faces in surveillance footage. This system enhances security by detecting unusual behavior and matching faces against a criminal database for real-time analysis and alerts.

## Project Overview
This project aims to enhance security by using machine learning techniques for anomaly detection and criminal face recognition in surveillance footage. The system identifies unusual behavior patterns and matches faces against a criminal database for real-time alerts, assisting in proactive threat management.

## Features
- **Anomaly Detection**: Detects unusual activities or behaviors based on movement and pattern analysis.
- **Criminal Face Recognition**: Matches faces from live footage against a criminal database.
- **Real-Time Alerts**: Sends alerts for detected anomalies or identified criminal faces.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Machine Learning**: OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras (or other libraries)
- **Database**: SQLite or MySQL for criminal records
- **Data Processing**: NumPy, Pandas

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/anomaly-detection-criminal-face-analysis.git

2. Install required dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the application:
    python main.py
